# General Documentation

Any tips or tricks to do with the tool chain can be added here to make it easier for other team members

## Logging Time
- Log time in the current day of the sprint on the [Burndown Chart google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G_qfX5CQOKYae3K1tQK2OcYnTJN1PDG4_hUfxowC9fE/edit#gid=0 "Burndown Chart")
- This will allow us to generate an accurate burndown chart for the sprint
- Only use multiples of 0.5 when inputting the time you have spent against a task
- If a task is finished then select that from the *Status* column

## Code Style
