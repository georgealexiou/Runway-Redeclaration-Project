# General Documentation

Any tips or tricks to do with the tool chain can be added here to make it easier for other team members

## Logging Time
- Log time in the current day of the sprint on the [Burndown Chart google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12ouB5b_Zud3r1gujTz02IZxac7_lKqGSz5FPRZcrpK8/edit?usp=sharing "Burndown Chart")
- This will allow us to generate an accurate burndown chart for the sprint
- Only use multiples of 0.5 when inputting the time you have spent against a task
- If a task is finished then select that from the *Status* column

## Linking Commits to Tickets on Trello
1. Select the card from the Trello Board
2. Select the GitHub Power up from the right hand menu
3. Attach the relevant thing
  - Branch if its a big feature in development
  - Commit if its a small fix
  - Pull request if it is being merged in to the master branch
4. Click the relevant commit/branch/pull request and it will be added as an attachment
